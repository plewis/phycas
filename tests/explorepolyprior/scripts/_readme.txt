The enumerate script enumerates all possible trees (including all possible
polytomous trees), then reads the file ../7taxa-unrooted-trees.t (generated by
explorepolyprior.py and provides a tally of the number of trees sampled for each
possible tree topology. Also, within each resolution class, if there are trees with
different shapes, a tally will be done for each shape to ensure that tree topologies
in any given resolution class are sampled equally regardless of their shape.
