This is the CHANGES file associated with the Python program Phycas
Phycas can be obtained from http://www.phycas.org/

We have started a new CHANGES file starting with version 2.0.0 because 2.0.0 is
the version associated with the official published release note describing
Phycas.

Version 2.0.1
-------------
Posted 5-August-2014
Added chain swap information to the updater summary when mcmc.nchains > 1 (and removed
the debugging output that cluttered the console previously). Parameter file now only
includes the log-likelihood for the cold chain (previously nchains log-likelihoods were
included in each row except the header row, which only included one "lnL" header).
