Third-party source code used in Phycas
--------------------------------------

Phycas makes use of a small number of third-party source code
files. 

DCDFLIB is used for numerical integration of probability distributions. The
library can be obtained from 

  http://www.csit.fsu.edu/~burkardt/cpp_src/dcdflib/dcdflib.html 

num_util was used for interfacing with numarray. The numarray library is
no longer used in Phycas, and if this functionality is eventually restored, 
NumPy will be used rather than numarray. This version of num_util 
does not appear to be available anymore, but the new version can be obtained
from 

  http://www.eos.ubc.ca/research/clouds/software/pythonlibs/num_util/num_util_release2/

The pyconversions.h file from HippoDraw is currently used for converting C++ arrays
and vectors to Python lists/tuples (and vice versa). We will eventually replace this
with our own code. The contents of this file can be obtained independently from 

  http://www.slac.stanford.edu/grp/ek/hippodraw/lib/pyconversions_8h-source.html
